# System Overview

The purpose of this system is to collect sequencing and quality control (QC) metrics, both historically and in real time, for the Genome Technologies (GT) production environment at JAX. The collected metrics are stored in a local DuckDB database (GTdashboardMetrics.duckdb, version 1.2.2), which is then pushed to a designated destination server. From there, the data is queried and sliced according to user interactions with the GT Dashboard, enabling dynamic filtering and visualization of relevant metrics.

The codebase supporting this system is primarily written in Bash and R, with some auxiliary logic implemented in Python. The system is designed for internal use by JAX staff and integrates tightly with production pipelines to provide reliable, up-to-date metrics for monitoring sequencing operations and QC performance.

> **Important:**
> Do **not** change permissions for `/srv/shiny-server/.usersProfile.json` and `/srv/shiny-server/log`.
> These files/folders must be owned by `shiny:shiny` set with `chown shiny:shiny` and have permissions `chmod 755` so the Shiny app can read, write, and execute as needed.

# FAQ + Troubleshooting Guide

### General Troubleshooting Philosophy

Admins should always check the relevant log files before jumping into troubleshooting. Not all issues affect the whole system ‚Äî ensure you're diagnosing the correct module where the issue originates:

* For sequencing page: check `SequencingMetrics_log.csv`
* For Dashboard QC page: check `DashboardMetrics_log.csv`
* For login issues: check `access_log.csv`
* For package/load errors: check `missing_libraries_log.csv`

### ‚ùì Common Questions

**Why do I see ‚ÄúNo Data‚Äù on the dashboard?**

* The data may not have been imported correctly.
* Possible reasons:

  * `GTdashboardMetrics.duckdb` wasn't updated. Click refetch button.
  * Filters (Year, App, Platform) selected have no matching data
  * `SequencingMetrics.csv` was missing or malformed. Therefore, did not get imported into the database

**Why does login sometimes fail or not recognize my email?**

* OTC code may have expired or been reused.
* Admins should check `access_log.csv` for clues.

**Why is my project/sample missing from the QC dashboard?**

* QC pipeline may have failed or skipped samples. 
    * check the following log paths;
        * /gt/data/seqdma/GTwebMetricsTables/.slurmlog
        * /gt/data/seqdma/GTwebMetricsTables/.logs
        * And for sequencing Metrics csv file, check 
            * /gt/data/seqdma/GTwebMetricsTables/SeqMetrics/.slurmlogSeqMet
* `project_ID` or `Sample_Name` casing mismatch.
* Admins should check which table (Illumina (qc_illumina_metrics), PacBio (qc_pacbio_metrics), ONT (qc_ont_metrics)) should have the data, and inspect the relevant logs. This tables can for instance be inspected using 
    *duckdb /gt/data/seqdma/GTwebMetricsTables/GTdashboardMetrics.duckdb "SELECT * FROM qc_illumina_metrics WHERE project_ID = 'GT24-RobsonP-94' LIMIT 10;" | less -S*


**üîÅ I updated a dropdown or hit Refetch, but nothing changes.**

* UI may be cached or slow to react. Wait or close the browser tab and re-enter the url. This way, linux server memory can be reset.
* Retry after 5‚Äì10 seconds.
* Check if DuckDB was updated. It is possible the data is not even imported. Use below to manually check that the project run is present 
    *duckdb /gt/data/seqdma/GTwebMetricsTables/GTdashboardMetrics.duckdb "SELECT * FROM qc_illumina_metrics WHERE Project_run_type = 'GT24-RobsonP-94-run2' LIMIT 10;" | less -S*
* See direcotry `/gt/data/seqdma/GTwebMetricsTables/.last_import_push` for last import time or check your email.

# Environment Requirements
